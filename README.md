# Transfer Learning on Object Detection Models
Creating an object detector with Transfer Learning on a pre-trained model Using TensorFlow's Object Detection API


* Example:- Transfer learning on ssd_mobilenet_v2_640x640 model to detect Mask, Face Sheild, Full Cover, Gloves, Goggles (using TF's Object Detection API)  
  I got a total loss < 0.25 after 4k steps (2 hrs of training).
